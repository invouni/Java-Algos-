# KMP Algorithm Implementation

This repository contains an implementation of the Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP) string matching algorithm in Java. The KMP algorithm is used to search for occurrences of a "pattern" string within a "text" string efficiently.

## Introduction

The KMP algorithm is an efficient string matching algorithm that improves upon the brute-force approach by preprocessing the pattern string. It utilizes an auxiliary array called the LPS (Longest Prefix Suffix) array to avoid redundant comparisons.

## Code Explanation

### Building the LPS Array

The `buildLPS` function constructs the LPS array for the given pattern string. The LPS array helps in determining the next positions to match after a mismatch occurs.

```java
private static int[] buildLPS(String str, int n) {
    int len = 0;
    int[] lps = new int[n];
    lps[0] = 0;
    int i = 1;
    while (i < n) {
        if (str.charAt(i) == str.charAt(len)) {
            len++;
            lps[i] = len;
            i++;
        } else {
            if (len != 0) {
                len = lps[len - 1];
            } else {
                lps[i] = 0;
                i++;
            }
        }
    }
    return lps;
}
```

- `str`: The pattern string.
- `n`: The length of the pattern string.
- `len`: The length of the previous longest prefix suffix.
- `lps`: The LPS array.

The function iterates over the pattern string and constructs the LPS array by comparing characters of the pattern string with itself.

### KMP Search Function

The `KMP` function searches for occurrences of the pattern string within the text string using the LPS array.

```java
private static void KMP(String s, String pat) {
    int n = s.length(), m = pat.length();
    int[] lps = buildLPS(pat, m);
    int j = 0, i = 0;
    while (i < n) {
        if (s.charAt(i) == pat.charAt(j)) {
            i++;
            j++;
        }
        if (j == m) {
            System.out.println("Found at " + (i - j));
            j = lps[j - 1];
        } else if (i < n && s.charAt(i) != pat.charAt(j)) {
            if (j != 0)
                j = lps[j - 1];
            else
                i++;
        }
    }
}
```

- `s`: The text string.
- `pat`: The pattern string.
- `n`: The length of the text string.
- `m`: The length of the pattern string.
- `lps`: The LPS array.
- `j`: Index for the pattern string.
- `i`: Index for the text string.

The function iterates over the text string and uses the LPS array to avoid redundant comparisons. When a mismatch occurs, the LPS array helps in determining the next positions to match.

## Usage

The `main` function demonstrates the usage of the KMP algorithm by searching for a pattern within a text string.

```java
public static void main(String[] args) {
    String str = "geeksforgeeks";
    String pattern = "geek";
    KMP(str, pattern);
}
```

- `str`: The text string.
- `pattern`: The pattern string.

The output of this example will be:
```
Found at 0
Found at 8
```

This means that the pattern "geek" is found at indices 0 and 8 in the text string "geeksforgeeks".

## Conclusion

The KMP algorithm is an efficient string matching algorithm that preprocesses the pattern string to avoid redundant comparisons. This implementation demonstrates the construction of the LPS array and the use of the KMP algorithm to search for occurrences of a pattern within a text string.
